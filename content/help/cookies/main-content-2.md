### Measuring website usage (Google Analytics and Webtrends)

We use Google Analytics and Webtrends software to collect information about
how you use NHS.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs
of its users and to help us make improvements, for example improving site search.

Google Analytics and Webtrends store information about:

* the pages you visit on NHS.UK
* how long you spend on each NHS.UK page
* how you got to the site
* what you click on while you’re visiting the site

We don’t collect or store your personal information (for example your name or address) so this information
can’t be used to identify who you are.
