## How long will it take for a sprain or strain to heal?

- After two weeks: most sprains and strains will feel better.
- Up to 8 weeks: avoid strenuous exercise such as running, as thereâ€™s a risk of
  further damage.

More severe sprains and strains can take several months to get back to normal.
