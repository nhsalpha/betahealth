## How to stop hand, foot and mouth disease spreading

Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily spread to other people. It’s spread in coughs, sneezes and poo.

You’re infectious from a few days before you have any symptoms, but you’re most likely to give it to others in the first five days after symptoms start.

To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:

- wash your hands often with warm water and soap (and teach children to do it)
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible
- don’t share towels or household items (such as cups or cutlery)
- wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash

### Stay off work, school or nursery

Stay off work or keep your child away from school or nursery while they’re feeling unwell.

Check with your school or nursery guidance on when children can return after hand, foot and mouth disease.


## Hand, foot and mouth disease in pregnancy

Although there’s normally no risk to the pregnancy or baby, it’s best to avoid close contact with anyone who has hand,
foot and mouth disease.

This is because:
- having a high temperature during the first 3 months of pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, although this is very rare
- getting hand, foot and mouth disease shortly before birth can mean the baby is born with a mild version of it

Speak to your GP or midwife if you have been in contact with someone with hand, foot and mouth disease.
