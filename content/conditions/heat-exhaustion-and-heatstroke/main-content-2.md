## First aid for heat exhaustion and heat stroke

You need to cool the person down. Follow these 5 steps:

1. move them to a cool place
1. remove any unnecessary clothing
1. get them to lie down and raise their feet slightly
1. get them to drink plenty of water (sports or rehydration drinks are ok)
1. cool their skin - spray or sponge them with cool water and fan them (ice packs around the armpits or neck are good too)

Every few minutes, check that their breathing and pulse are ok.

Stay with them until they are better.

They should start to cool down and feel better within 30 minutes.
