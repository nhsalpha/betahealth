## Check for signs of heat exhaustion

The signs of heat exhaustion include:

- headache
- dizziness and confusion
- loss of appetite and feeling sick
- excessive sweating and pale clammy skin
- cramps in the arms, legs and stomach
- fast breathing or pulse
- temperature of 37C or above
- intense thirst

The symptoms are often the same in adults and children, although children may
become floppy and sleepy.

Heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke if left untreated.
