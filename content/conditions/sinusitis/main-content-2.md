## How you can treat sinusitis yourself

You can often treat mild sinusitis without seeing your GP.

To relieve sinus pain, take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Donâ€™t
give aspirin to children under 16.

You can also relieve sinus pain by:

1. soaking a clean flannel in warm water
2. holding it against your forehead and cheeks for 5 to 10 minutes
3. repeating this 3 or 4 times a day

To help unblock your nose, try regularly cleaning the inside of your nose with
a salt water solution.
