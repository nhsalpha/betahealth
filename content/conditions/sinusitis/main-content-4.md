## Treatment from a GP

Your GP may prescribe a steroid nasal spray or drops to reduce the swelling in
your sinuses.

You might need to take these for a few months and they sometimes cause
irritation, sore throats or nosebleeds.

Your GP may prescribe antibiotics for a bacterial infection. However, sinusitis
is usually caused by a cold or flu virus.

Your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if:

- other treatments haven’t helped
- you’ve had sinusitis for longer than 3 months (chronic sinusitis)

In some cases, you might be offered surgery.

## Surgery for sinusitis

Surgery to treat chronic sinusitis is called functional endoscopic sinus
surgery (FESS).

FESS is carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep).

The surgeon can widen your sinuses by either:

- removing some of the blocked skin tissue
- inflating a tiny balloon in the blocked sinuses, then removing it

You should be able to have FESS within 18 weeks of your GP appointment.
