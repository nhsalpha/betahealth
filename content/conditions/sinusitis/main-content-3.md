## Your pharmacist can help with sinusitis

Your pharmacist can recommend a decongestant nasal spray, tablets or drops to
help unblock your nose and allow you to breathe more easily. You can buy these
without a prescription, but they shouldn't be used for more than a week.

Some decongestant tablets contain paracetamol or ibuprofen. Be careful not to
take more than the recommended dose.

Some pharmacies also sell sachets you can use to make a salt water solution and
devices to help rinse your nose.
