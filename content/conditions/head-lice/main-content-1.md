Head lice sometimes can make your head feel:

* itchy
* like something is moving in your hair

The only way to be sure someone has head lice is by finding live lice or
eggs. You can do this by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed
comb (detection comb). You can buy these online or at pharmacies.
