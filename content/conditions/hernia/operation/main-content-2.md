## Groin hernia operation

There are two types of groin hernia operation:

### Open surgery

1. You’ll be given an injection in the spine to numb the area (local
   anaesthetic), or an injection into the vein to make you sleep during the
   operation (general anaesthetic).
1. The surgeon makes a cut (6-8cm long) over the hernia. They will push the
   hernia back into your tummy and stitch a mesh over the weak spot the hernia
   came through. This strengthens it.
1. Your skin will be stitched back together with dissolvable stitches.

### Keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery

1. You’ll be given an injection to make you sleep during the operation (general
   anaesthetic).
1. The surgeon makes 3 small cuts in your tummy. Your tummy is filled with gas
   to make space and a camera and 2 small tools are inserted into the
   cuts. Your surgeon can see what they’re doing through the camera.

   over the weak spot in the muscle.
