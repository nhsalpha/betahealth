You’ll need an operation to fix a hernia.

You may not need an operation straight away. Your hernia won’t get better
without surgery, but it doesn’t always get worse. You can discuss with your
doctor whether or not you need surgery. They’ll consider:

* the type of hernia you have - some are more prone to complications
* if your hernia is causing problems, such as pain
* your health - surgery may be a risk in some cases
