## 6. Day of your surgery

When you arrive at the hospital go to the reception desk at your ward. Bring
the letter with the confirmation of your surgery date with you.

## 7. Going home and recovery

You can go home when you feel well enough, and can eat and drink. You must be
able to walk (if you’re not in a wheelchair) and pee.

You’ll need someone to help you home by car or taxi and stay with you for at
least 24 hours.
