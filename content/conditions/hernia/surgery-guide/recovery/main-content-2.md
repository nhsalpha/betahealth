## Stay active

You should move around as soon as possible after surgery. This encourages your
blood to flow and your wound to heal.

You can do gentle activities like walking but don’t lift heavy objects for
around 6 weeks.

Generally, you should be able to go back to work after 1 or 2 weeks, unless
your job involves manual labour.

It’s usually okay to have sex as soon as you feel like it.
