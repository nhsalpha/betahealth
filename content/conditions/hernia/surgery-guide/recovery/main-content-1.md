## Going home

You can go home when you feel well enough, and can eat and drink. You must be
able to walk (if you’re not in a wheelchair) and pee.

Your surgeon will check on you before you go home.

You’ll get a box of medication including painkillers to take home.

You’ll get a copy of your discharge letter explaining what has happened (which
will also be sent to your GP) and a sick note if you need one.

## Help with your recovery

You’re likely to feel very tired when you get home, particularly if you’ve had
a general anaesthetic (you were asleep during the operation).

It’s normal for your wound and groin to be swollen for a few days.

## Take painkillers to help with pain

Follow your doctor’s advice about taking medication. They’re likely to
recommend:

* paracetamol
* paracetamol and codeine (combined in the tablet co-codamol)
* ibuprofen

Some painkillers can cause constipation. You can buy laxative medicine from
your pharmacy to help this.

## Look after your wound

You will have a waterproof dressing covering the wound so you can shower. You
can change it after 2 days. Keep the dressing clean and as dry as possible.

You will most likely have dissolvable stitches, which do not need to be
removed. If you have non-dissolvable stitches or staples, make an appointment
with the nurse at your GP surgery to remove them.

If you are constipated, avoid straining while your wound is healing. Take
laxatives to help with your constipation.
