## 1. Booking a hospital appointment with the surgeon

Your GP might book your first appointment with the surgeon for you. If they
don’t, you’ll get a letter with a reference number to book online or over the
phone.

You can choose which hospital you want to go to. Once booked, you’ll get a
confirmation in the post.

## 2. Seeing a surgeon

Approx 6 weeks{.meta}

The surgeon will explain what treatment options you have, and the benefits and
risks of surgery. You can ask them any questions. This is the time when you
decide if you want to go ahead with the operation.

## 3. Confirming your surgery date

Approx 2 weeks{.meta}

After your appointment with the surgeon you’ll get a letter confirming the
date of your operation.

You can change the date but you might have to wait several weeks to get a
new one.

## 4. Checking you’re fit for surgery

Approx 3 weeks{.meta}

If you’re having a general anaesthetic, you’ll have an appointment with a
nurse at the hospital to make sure you’re healthy enough for surgery. This is
called a pre-operative assessment or pre-op.

If you’re not healthy enough, the operation may be postponed.

## 5. Getting ready for surgery

Approx 2 weeks{.meta}

The nurse will tell you how to prepare for the operation. You might have to do
things like change or stop taking your medicine.

On the morning of your surgery, you should:

* have a bath or shower
* remove all jewellery, including any piercings
