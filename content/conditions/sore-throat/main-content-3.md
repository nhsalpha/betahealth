### Antibiotics

GPs don’t usually prescribe antibiotics for sore throats because they won’t relieve your symptoms or speed up your recovery.

## Causes and symptoms of sore throats

Sore throats are usually caused by viruses (like cold or flu) or from smoking.

Symptoms include:

- painful throat especially when swallowing
- dry scratchy throat
- redness in the back of the mouth
- bad breath
- mild cough
- swollen neck glands

The symptoms are similar for children, but children can also get a temperature and appear less active.
