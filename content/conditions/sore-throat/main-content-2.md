## Your pharmacist can help with sore throats

To help relieve the pain and discomfort of a sore throat you can:

- use paracetamol or ibuprofen
- use medicated lozenges or anaesthetic sprays (although thereâ€™s little proof they help)

You can buy them from a supermarket or from a pharmacist without a prescription.
