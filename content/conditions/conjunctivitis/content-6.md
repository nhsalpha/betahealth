###  Staying away from work or school

You donâ€™t need to avoid work or school unless you or your child are feeling very unwell.

If there are a few children with conjunctivitis at your child's school you might be asked to keep yours at home.

## Your pharmacist can help with conjunctivitis

Your pharmacist can recommend eye drops or antihistamines to help with your symptoms.
