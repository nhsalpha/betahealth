## Treatment from your GP

Treatment will depend on what caused your conjunctivitis. If it’s a bacterial infection you might be prescribed antibiotics, but they won’t work if it's caused by a virus (viral conjunctivitis) or by an allergy.

Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause conjunctivitis which takes longer to clear up.
