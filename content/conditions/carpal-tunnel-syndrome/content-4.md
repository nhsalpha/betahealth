## What happens at your appointment

Your GP can usually diagnose CTS by asking about your symptoms and checking your hand.

If they're not sure it's CTS, they may refer you to hospital for tests, such as an ultrasound scan.

## Treatment from your GP

If a wrist splint hasn’t helped, your GP might recommend a steroid injection into your wrist. This brings down swelling around the nerve which eases the symptoms of CTS.

Steroid injections aren’t always a cure. CTS can come back after a few months and you may need another injection.

## Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery

If your CTS is getting worse and other treatments haven’t worked, your GP might refer to you a specialist to discuss surgery.

Surgery usually cures CTS. You and your specialist will decide together if it’s the right treatment for you.

The operation takes around 20 minutes and you won’t have to stay in hospital overnight.

An injection numbs your wrist so you won’t feel pain (local anaesthetic) and a small cut is made in your hand. The carpal tunnel inside your wrist is cut so it no longer puts pressure on the nerve.

It can take a month after the operation to get back to normal activities.

## What causes carpal tunnel syndrome

CTS happens when the carpal tunnel inside your wrist swells and squeezes one of your nerves (median nerve).

You’re more at risk if you:

- are overweight
- are pregnant
- do work or hobbies that mean you repeatedly bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools
- have another illness, such as arthritis or diabetes
- have a parent, brother or sister with CTS
- have previously injured your wrist
