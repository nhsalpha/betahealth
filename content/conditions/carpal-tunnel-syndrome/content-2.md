## Check if you have carpal tunnel syndrome

The symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) include:

- an ache or pain in your fingers, hand or arm
- numb hands
- tingling or pins and needles
- a weak thumb or difficulty gripping

These symptoms often start slowly and come and go. They are usually worse at night.

## How to treat carpal tunnel syndrome yourself

CTS sometimes clears up by itself in a few months, particularly if you have it because you’re pregnant.

### Wear a wrist splint

A wrist splint is something you wear on your hand to keep your wrist straight. It helps to relieve pressure on the nerve.

You wear it at night while you sleep. You'll have to wear a splint for at least 4 weeks before you start to feel better.

You can buy wrist splints online or from pharmacies.

### Stop or cut down on things that may be causing it

Stop or cut down on anything that causes you to frequently bend your wrist or grip hard, such as using vibrating tools for work or playing an instrument.

### Don’t take painkillers

There’s little evidence to say that painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen help with CTS.

### Alternative treatments

There’s a small amount of evidence to say hand exercises, yoga and acupuncture help ease the symptoms of CTS.
