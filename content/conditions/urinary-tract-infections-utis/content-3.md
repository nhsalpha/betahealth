## What happens at your appointment 

You'll be asked about your symptoms and may need to give a urine sample to confirm you have a UTI. 

A urine test can't tell which type of UTI you have, but it helps to rule out other causes.

Some men may be offered a swab test to check for other conditions. This is where a cotton bud is wiped on the tip of the penis and sent for testing.

:::reveal How to collect and store a urine sample

Your doctor may ask for a "mid-stream" urine sample. This is where you don't collect the first or last part of your pee.

You'll be given a sterile container and it's usually possible to give the sample in the doctor's surgery.

If you need to collect the sample at home, keep it in the fridge in a sealed plastic bag. Don't keep it in the fridge for more than 24 hours.

:::reveal What are lower and upper UTIs?

Your GP may describe a UTI as:

- **a lower UTI** - if you have urethritis or cystitis (bladder infection) 
- **an upper UTI** - if you have a kidney infection

## Treatment from a GP

Your doctor will prescribe [antibiotics](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Antibiotics-penicillins/Pages/Introduction.aspx) to treat a UTI. 

Once you start treatment, the symptoms should start to clear up within 5 days in adults and 2 days in children. 

It’s important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.

### Treating recurring UTIs

If your UTI comes back after treatment, your doctor will usually prescribe a longer course of antibiotics. 

If you keep getting UTIs and regularly need treatment, you may be given a repeat antibiotics prescription.

## Treatment in hospital

Some people with a severe UTI need to go to hospital for tests or treatment.

Treatment in hospital usually lasts a few days and may include: 

- fluids or antibiotics given directly into a vein through a drip
- blood and urine tests to make sure the antibiotics are working
- scans to check for problems with the urinary tract

## Things you can do yourself

To help ease pain while your symptoms clear up:

- take painkillers such as [paracetamol](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Painkillers-paracetamol/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - you can give children liquid paracetamol
- **don’t** take  [NSAIDs](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Anti-inflammatories-non-steroidal/Pages/Introduction.aspx) such as [ibuprofen](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Painkillers-ibuprofen/Pages/Introduction.aspx) or [aspirin](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/anti-platelets-aspirin-low-dose-/Pages/Introduction.aspx) if you have a kidney infection - this may increase the risk of kidney problems
- place a hot water bottle on your tummy, back or between your thighs
- rest and drink plenty of fluids - this helps your body to flush out the bacteria

It may also help to avoid having sex until you feel better. You can't pass a UTI on to your partner but sex may be uncomfortable.

## You can't always prevent UTIs

UTIs are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract. The bacteria enters through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).

Women have a shorter urethra, so bacteria is more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys.

There are some things you can do to try and prevent a UTI.
