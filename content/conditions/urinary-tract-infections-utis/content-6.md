:::reveal Things that increase the risk of UTIs

- pregnancy
- conditions that block the urinary tract - such as [kidney stones](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/kidney-stones/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder - such as an [enlarged prostate gland](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Prostate-enlargement/Pages/Introduction.aspx) in men and [constipation](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation) in children
- [urinary catheters](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-catheterization/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
