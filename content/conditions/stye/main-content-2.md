## Treatment from a GP

Your GP may:

- burst the stye with a thin, sterilised needle
- remove the eyelash closest to the stye  
- refer you to an eye specialist in hospital

## You can’t always prevent a stye

Styes are often caused by bacteria infecting an eyelash follicle or eyelid gland. You’re also more likely to get a
stye if you have long-term [blepharitis](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Blepharitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx).

You can help to prevent styes with some simple hygiene measures.
