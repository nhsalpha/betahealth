## Ask for an urgent GP appointment or go to A&E if:

- your face or the area around your eye (periorbital) is affected
- your symptoms are rapidly getting worse (this could be a sign of something more serious like the rare condition necrotising fasciitis)
- you have a weakened immune system, for example because of chemotherapy or diabetes
- a young child or elderly person has possible cellulitis

Early treatment with antibiotics can stop the infection becoming more serious.
