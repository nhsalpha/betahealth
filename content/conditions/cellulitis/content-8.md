## What causes cellulitis

Cellulitis is usually caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria can infect the deeper layers of your skin if it’s broken, for example because of an insect bite or cut, or if it’s cracked and dry.

Sometimes the break in the skin is too small to notice.

You can't catch cellulitis from another person as it affects the deeper layer of the skin.
