## Treatment from your GP

For mild cellulitis, affecting a small area of skin, your GP will prescribe antibiotic tablets - usually for a week.

Your symptoms might get worse in the first 48 hours of treatment, but should then start to improve.

It’s important to keep taking antibiotics until they’re finished, even when you feel better.

Most people make a full recovery after 7 to 10 days.

If your cellulitis is severe your GP might refer you to hospital for treatment.

### To stop cellulitis recurring

Some people with recurring cellulitis might be prescribed low-dose, long-term antibiotics to stop infections coming back.

## Things you can do yourself

As well as taking antibiotics you can help to speed up your recovery by:

- taking paracetamol or ibuprofen for the pain
- raising the affected body part on a pillow or chair when you’re sitting or lying down, to reduce swelling
- regularly moving the joint near the affected body part, such as your wrist or ankle, to stop it getting stiff
- drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration
- not wearing compression stockings until you’re better

You can reduce the chances of getting cellulitis again by:

- keeping skin clean and well moisturised
- cleaning any cuts or wounds, or using antiseptic cream
- preventing cuts and scrapes by wearing appropriate clothing and footwear
- wearing gloves if working outside

## Cellulitis complications

If not treated quickly the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the blood, muscle and bone.
