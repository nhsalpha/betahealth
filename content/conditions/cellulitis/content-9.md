Anyone can get cellulitis, but you’re more at risk if you:

- have poor circulation in your arms, legs, hands or feet, for example because you’re overweight
- find it difficult to move around
- have a weakened immune system, because of chemotherapy treatment or diabetes
- have [pressure ulcers (bedsores)](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pressure-ulcers/pages/introduction.aspx) 
- have [lymphoedema,](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lymphoedema/Pages/Introduction.aspx) which causes fluid build up under the skin
- inject drugs
- have a wound from surgery
- have had cellulitis before

People who are more at risk of cellulitis should treat any [athlete's foot](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Athletes-foot/Pages/Introduction.aspx) promptly.
