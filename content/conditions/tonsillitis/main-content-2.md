If you’re not sure it’s tonsillitis [check other sore throat symptoms](/conditions/sore-throat).

## How long tonsillitis lasts

Symptoms will usually go away after 3 to 4 days.

Tonsillitis isn’t contagious but the infections that cause it are (for example,
colds and flu).

To stop these infections from spreading:

- stay off work or keep your child at home until you or your child feel better
- use tissues when you cough or sneeze and throw them away after
- wash your hands after coughing or sneezing

## How to treat tonsillitis yourself

Tonsillitis usually has to run its course. To help ease the symptoms:

- get plenty of rest
- drink cool drinks to soothe the throat
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen (don’t give aspirin to children under 16)
- gargle with warm salty water
