## What happens at your appointment

Your doctor can usually tell its tonsillitis by asking about your symptoms and
looking at the back of your throat. Sometimes they might:

- wipe a cotton bud at the back of your throat to test for bacteria
- organise a blood test to rule out [glandular fever](/conditions/glandular-fever) (if your symptoms are severe or won’t go away)

Usually you’ll get any test results back within a couple of days.

## Treatment from a GP

Treatment will depend on what caused your tonsillitis:

- a virus (viral tonsillitis), which most children and adults have - this type
  has to run its course and antibiotics won’t help
- bacteria (bacterial tonsillitis) - your GP may prescribe antibiotics

Usually your GP will have to wait for the test results to tell which type you have.
