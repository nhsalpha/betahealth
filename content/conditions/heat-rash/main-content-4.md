## Causes of heat rash

Heat rash is usually caused by excessive sweating.

Sweat glands get blocked and the trapped sweat causes a rash to develop a few
days later.

Babies often get it because they canâ€™t control their temperature as well as
adults and children.

Sweating is usually caused by hot or humid weather but other things can cause
it. For example, being overweight or spending long periods in bed, perhaps
because of an illness.
