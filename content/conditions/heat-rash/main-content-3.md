## Your pharmacist can help with heat rash

To help soothe sore and itchy skin you can:

- use calamine lotion
- use hydrocortisone cream (but not on the face)
- take antihistamine tablets (but speak to a pharmacist first as they’re not
  always appropriate)

You can buy these from a pharmacy. The pharmacist can advise you on the best
medicines to use, for example if you’re pregnant or a child has the rash.
