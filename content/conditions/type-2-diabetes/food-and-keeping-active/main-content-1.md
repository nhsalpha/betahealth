## Food and keeping active

A healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar level.
They’ll also help you to control your weight and generally feel better.

### You can eat many types of foods

There’s nothing you can’t eat, but you’ll have to limit certain foods.

You should:

* eat a wide range of foods - including fruit, vegetables, some starchy foods
  such as pasta
* keep sugar, fat and salt to a minimum
* eat breakfast, lunch and dinner every day - don’t skip meals

If you need to change your diet, it might be easier to make small changes every
week.
