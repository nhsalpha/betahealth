## Your pharmacist can help with mouth ulcers

Your pharmacist can recommend a treatment to speed up healing, prevent infection or reduce pain, for example:

- antimicrobial mouthwash 
- a painkilling mouthwash, gel or spray
- corticosteroid lozenges

You can buy these without a prescription but they may not always work.
