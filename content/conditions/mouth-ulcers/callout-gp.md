## See a dentist or GP if your mouth ulcer:

- lasts longer than 3 weeks
- keeps coming back
- becomes more painful and red - this may be a sign of an infection

***

Although most mouth ulcers are harmless, a long-lasting mouth ulcer is sometimes a sign of mouth cancer. Itâ€™s best to get it checked.
