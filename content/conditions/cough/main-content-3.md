## What happens at your appointment

Many things can cause a cough and your GP might:

- take a sample of any mucus you might be coughing up
- order an X-ray, allergy test, or test to see how well your lungs work
- refer you to hospital to see a specialist, but this is very rare

## What causes coughs

Most coughs are caused by cold or flu.

Other causes include:

- smoking
- allergies, for example hay fever
- infections like bronchitis
- mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose

A cough is very rarely a sign of something serious like lung cancer.
