## Your pharmacist can help with a cough

You can use cough medicines like syrups and lozenges to help you cough less.
However, they won’t get rid of the cough. It will get better naturally, without
treatment.

Some cough medicines shouldn’t be given to children under 12. Speak with your
pharmacist first.
