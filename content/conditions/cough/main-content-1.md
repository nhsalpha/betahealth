## Treating a cough yourself

Most coughs go away on their own within 3 weeks. There’s usually no need to see
a doctor.

To help with your cough you can:

- rest
- drink plenty of fluids
- drink hot lemon with honey (not suitable for babies)

Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect as cough medicines.

::: reveal How to make hot lemon with honey at home
1. Squeeze half a lemon into a mug
1. Fill the mug with boiled water
1. Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey (depending on how sweet you want it)
1. Drink while still warm (don’t give very hot drinks to small children)

## Your pharmacist can help with a cough

You can use cough medicines like syrups and lozenges to help you cough less.
However, they won’t get rid of the cough. It will get better naturally, without
treatment.

Some cough medicines shouldn’t be given to children under 12. Speak with your
pharmacist first.
