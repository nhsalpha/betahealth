## Treating a cough yourself

Most coughs go away on their own within 3 weeks. Thereâ€™s usually no need to see
a doctor.

To help with your cough you can:

- rest
- drink plenty of fluids
- drink hot lemon with honey (not suitable for babies)

Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect as cough medicines.
