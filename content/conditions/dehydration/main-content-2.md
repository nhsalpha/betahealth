## How to prevent dehydration

Drink enough during the day so that your pee is a pale clear colour.

Drink when you feel thirsty or when there is a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you’re vomiting, sweating or you have diarrhoea.

### Carers: making sure someone drinks enough

Sometimes people you care for don’t have a sense of how much they’re drinking.

To help them:

- make sure they drink during meal times
- make drinking a social thing like ‘having a cup of tea’
- offer them food with a high water content - for example, soups, ice cream, jellies or fruits like melon
