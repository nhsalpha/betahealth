## Check if you’re dehydrated

Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:

- feeling thirsty
- dark yellow and strong smelling pee
- feeling dizzy or lightheaded
- feeling tired
- dry mouth, lips and eyes
- peeing little and less than 4 times a day

If you have [diabetes](/conditions/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it) or alcoholism
you can dehydrate much more easily.

## How you can treat dehydration yourself

Drink fluids when you feel any dehydration symptoms. Keep taking small sips. You can use a spoon to make it easier
for your child to swallow the fluids.

When you’re dehydrated your body also loses salt and sugar. To help restore sugar and salt levels you can drink:

- water
- fruit juice or squash mixed with water
- salty things like soup

Make sure you give your child a mix of these things so they can get back the sugars, salts or minerals they have lost.

## Your pharmacist can help with dehydration

You can buy special sachets from a pharmacy. They’re called oral rehydration solutions and you mix them with water.
They contain salt, sugar and minerals that your body loses when you’re not drinking enough.

Ask your pharmacist which ones are right for you or your child.
