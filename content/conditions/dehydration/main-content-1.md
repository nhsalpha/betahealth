## Check if you’re dehydrated

Symptoms of dehydration in adults and children include:

- feeling thirsty
- dark yellow and strong smelling pee
- feeling dizzy or lightheaded
- feeling tired
- dry mouth, lips and eyes
- peeing little and less than 4 times a day

Dehydration can happen more easily if you have: 
- [diabetes](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it)
- vomiting or diarrhoea
- been in the sun too long [(heatstroke)](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/heat-exhaustion-and-heatstroke)
- drunk too much alcohol
- sweated too much after exercising
- a high temperature of 38C or more


## How you can reduce the risk of dehydration

Drink fluids when you feel any dehydration symptoms. Keep taking small sips and gradually drink more if you can. You can use a spoon to make it easier for your child to swallow the fluids.

You should drink enough during the day so that your pee is a pale clear colour.  
Drink when there is a higher risk of dehydrating. For example, if you’re vomiting, sweating or you have diarrhoea. 


## Your pharmacist can help with dehydration

If you’re being sick or have diarrhoea and are losing too much fluid you need to put back the sugar, salts and minerals that your body has lost. 
 
Your pharmacist can recommend oral rehydration sachets. These are powders that you mix with water and then drink. 

Ask your pharmacist which ones are right for you or your child.
