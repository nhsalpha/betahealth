## Complications of long-term constipation

Long-term constipation can lead to faecal impaction. This is where poo has built up in your rectum.
The main symptom is [diarrhoea](/conditions/diarrhoea/)
after a long bout of constipation.

Faecal impaction may be treated with:

- stronger laxatives - prescribed by your GP
- a suppository - medicine you place in your bottom
- a mini enema - where fluid is passed through your bottom, into your bowel
- a doctor removing some of the poo
