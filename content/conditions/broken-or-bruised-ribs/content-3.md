### Do

- take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen - avoid taking ibuprofen for 48 hours after your injury as it may slow down healing
- hold an ice pack (or bag of frozen peas in a tea towel) to the affected ribs regularly in the first few days to bring down swelling
- rest and take time off work if you need to
- breathe normally and cough when you need to - this helps clear mucus from your lungs to prevent chest infections
- if you need to cough, hold a pillow against your chest
- walk around and sometimes move your shoulders to help you breathe and clear mucus from your lungs
- take 10 slow, deep breaths every hour to help clear your lungs
- try to sleep more upright for the first few nights
