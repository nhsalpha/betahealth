## Check if you have a bruised or broken rib

Broken (fractured) or bruised ribs are usually caused by a fall, a blow to the chest or severe coughing.

Symptoms include:

- strong pain in your chest area, particularly when you breathe in
- swelling or tenderness around the affected ribs
- sometimes bruising on the skin
