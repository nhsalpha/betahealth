## How you can treat a cold yourself

To help you get better more quickly:

- rest and sleep
- keep warm
- drink plenty of water (fruit juice or squash mixed with water is ok) to [avoid dehydration](/conditions/dehydration#how-to-prevent-dehydration)
- gargle salt water to soothe a [sore throat](/conditions/sore-throat)

## Your pharmacist can help with cold medicines

You can buy cough and cold medicines from pharmacies or supermarkets. Your pharmacist can
advise you on the best medicine. You can:

- relieve a blocked nose with decongestant sprays or tablets
- ease aches or lower a temperature with painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen

Be careful not to use them if you're taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets
as it’s easy to take more than the recommended dose.

Some are not suitable for children, babies and pregnant women.

There’s little evidence that supplements (such as vitamin c, zinc, echinacea or
garlic) prevent colds or speed up recovery.
