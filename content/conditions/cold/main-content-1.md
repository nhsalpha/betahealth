## Check if you have a cold

Cold symptoms come on gradually and can include:

- blocked or runny nose
- sore throat
- headaches
- muscle aches
- coughs
- sneezing
- a high temperature (38C in adults, 37.5C in children)
- pressure in your ears and face
- loss of taste and smell

The symptoms are the same in adults and children. Sometimes, symptoms last
longer in children.
