## Check if your vaginal discharge is normal

Usually, vaginal discharge is not anything to worry about if it:

- doesn’t have a strong or unpleasant smell
- is clear or white
- is thick and sticky
- is slippery and wet

You can get vaginal discharge at any age.

The amount of discharge varies. You usually get heavier discharge during
pregnancy or if you’re sexually active or using birth control. It’s often
slippery and wet for a few days between your periods (when you ovulate).

## When it can be a sign of an infection

If your discharge changes (for example, its smell, colour or texture) it might
be a sign of an infection.
