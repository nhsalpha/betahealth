## See your GP if:

- you feel very sick and keep vomiting
- you have no appetite and you’re losing weight
- your poo is very dark and smelly (this may indicate blood in your poo)
- the diarrhoea doesn’t go away
- you have recently taken antibiotics or been treated in hospital

***
Diarrhoea can be infectious. Check with your GP before you go in. They may suggest a phone consultation.
