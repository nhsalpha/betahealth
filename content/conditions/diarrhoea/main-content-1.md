## How you can treat diarrhoea yourself

Diarrhoea should go away on its own within a few days. It’s normal to also have stomach cramps and headaches.

It’s important that you drink enough fluids to [avoid dehydration](/conditions/dehydration).
Your pee should be light yellow or clear.

Drink small sips of things like water mixed with juice and soup broth to make sure you get enough salt and sugar.

As soon as you feel able to eat, try things like potatoes, rice, bananas, soup, boiled vegetables or salty foods.

To help with headaches or fevers you can take painkillers like paracetamol or ibuprofen.

## Your pharmacist can help with diarrhoea

You can take medicines to help reduce the diarrhoea and shorten how long it lasts. However, you don’t have to
take these and they won’t cure your diarrhoea.

Describe your symptoms to your pharmacist. They can recommend the best medicine for you.

Frail or elderly people can dehydrate more easily. You can get sachets with salt, sugar and minerals at the pharmacy
that will help you stay hydrated. They’re called oral rehydration solutions.
