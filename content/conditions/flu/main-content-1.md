## Check if you have flu

Flu symptoms come on very quickly and can include:

- a sudden fever - a temperature of 38C or above
- aching body
- feeling tired or exhausted
- dry, chesty cough
- sore throat
- headache
- difficulty sleeping
- loss of appetite
- diarrhoea or tummy pain
- nausea and being sick

The symptoms are similar for children but they can also get pain in their ear and appear less active.
