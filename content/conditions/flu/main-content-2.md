## How to treat flu yourself

To help you get better more quickly:

- rest and sleep
- keep warm
- take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower your temperature and treat aches and pains
- drink plenty of water to [avoid dehydration](/conditions/dehydration#how-to-prevent-dehydration)
  (your pee should be light yellow or clear)

## Your pharmacist can help with flu

Your pharmacist can give treatment advice and recommend flu remedies.

Be careful not to use them if you’re taking paracetamol and ibuprofen tablets as it’s easy to take more than the recommended dose.

Speak to your pharmacist before giving medicines to children.
