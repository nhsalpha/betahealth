## Check if it’s a slipped disc

A slipped disc (also called a prolapsed or herniated disc) can cause:

- lower back pain - the most common symptom
- numbness or tingling in your shoulders, back, arms, hands, legs or feet
- neck pain
- problems bending or straightening your back
- muscle weakness
- pain in the buttocks, hips or legs if the disc is pressing on the sciatic nerve ([sciatica](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sciatica/Pages/Introduction.aspx))

Not all slipped discs cause symptoms. Many people will never know they have
slipped a disc.

## Other causes of back pain

Sometimes the pain may be a result of an injury such as a [sprain or strain](/conditions/sprains-and-strains),
but often there’s no obvious reason.
[Back pain](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Back-pain/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
is rarely caused by anything serious.


## How you can ease the pain yourself

### Keep active

If the pain is very bad, you may need to rest at first. But start gentle
exercise as soon as you can - it will help you get better faster.

The type of exercise isn’t important - just gradually increase your activity
level.

### Take painkillers

Use painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (children under 16 shouldn’t
  take aspirin). Take them regularly (the recommended daily amount), not just
  when the pain is particularly bad. This will help you to keep moving.

Paracetamol on its own isn't recommended for back pain, but you can take it
with ibuprofen if the pain is very bad.

## Your pharmacist can help with a slipped disc

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen aren’t suitable
for everyone. Speak to a pharmacist if you're not sure.

Stronger painkillers containing codeine may help for pain that has just started.
But these types of painkillers can cause addiction and should only be used for
a few days.
