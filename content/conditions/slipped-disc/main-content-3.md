## Surgery for a slipped disc

Surgery isn’t usually needed, but your GP might refer to you a specialist to
discuss surgery if your symptoms:

- haven't improved using other treatments
- include worsening muscle weakness, or numbness

## Alternative treatments for slipped disc

There’s a small amount of evidence to say other treatments like acupuncture,
osteopathy and chiropractic can help ease some types of pain.

You'll usually have to pay for this treatment privately.

## What causes slipped disc

They can happen because of:

- ageing
- exercising too hard
- lifting heavy objects the wrong way
- vibration - from driving or operating machinery
- being inactive or overweight
