## Surgery for a slipped disc

Surgery isn’t usually needed, but your GP might refer to you a specialist to
discuss surgery if your symptoms:

- haven't improved using other treatments
- include worsening muscle weakness, or numbness

## Alternative treatments for slipped disc

There’s some evidence that manual therapies like osteopathy can help ease lower
back pain.

You'll usually have to pay for this treatment privately.

## What causes slipped disc

- ageing
- exercising too hard
