## What happens at your appointment

Your GP will usually be able to tell if you have a slipped disc from your
symptoms.

You may also have a physical examination. Your GP might ask you to raise your
arms, or do simple leg exercises, to find out where the slipped disc is.

## Treatment from your GP

Your GP might prescribe a stronger painkiller, a steroid injection or a
muscle relaxant to use in the short term.

If your symptoms don't get better they might recommend further tests like an
MRI scan.

Your GP might also refer you to a physiotherapist. If the waiting list for an
NHS physio appointment is too long you can pay for it yourself.
