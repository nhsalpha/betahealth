## See a GP if you have:

- a high temperature of 38C or above
- a severe sore throat
- swollen glands - swelling either side of your neck
- extreme tiredness or exhaustion
- tonsillitis that isnâ€™t getting better

These are glandular fever symptoms. You don't usually get glandular fever
more than once.
