## Check if you have insomnia

You have insomnia if you regularly:

- find it hard to go to sleep
- wake up several times during the night
- lie awake at night
- wake up early and can’t go back to sleep
- still feel tired after waking up
- find it hard to nap during the day even though you're tired
- feel tired and irritable during the day
- find it difficult to concentrate during the day because you're tired

You can have these symptoms for months, sometimes years.

### How much sleep you need

Everyone needs different amounts of sleep. On average we need:

- adults: 7 to 9 hours
- children: 9 to 13 hours
- toddlers and babies: 12 to 17 hours

If you’re constantly tired during the day you probably don’t get enough sleep.
