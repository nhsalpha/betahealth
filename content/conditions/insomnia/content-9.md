## Treatment from your GP

To get you the right treatment your GP will try to find out what’s causing your insomnia.

Sometimes your GP will refer you to a therapist for [cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Cognitive-behavioural-therapy/Pages/Introduction.aspx). This can help you change the thoughts and behaviours that keep you from sleeping.

GPs now rarely prescribe sleeping pills to treat insomnia. Sleeping pills can have serious side effects and you can become dependent on them.

Sleeping pills are only prescribed for a few days or weeks at the most if:

- your insomnia is very bad
- other treatments haven’t worked
