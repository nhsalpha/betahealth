## Preventing ear infections

You can’t always prevent ear infections, particularly inner ear infections
caused by colds and flu.

To help avoid inner ear infections:

- make sure your child is up-to-date with vaccinations
- keep your child away from smoky environments
- try not to give your child a dummy after they’re 6 months old

To help avoid outer ear infections:

- don’t stick cotton wool buds or your fingers in your ears
- use ear plugs or a swimming hat over your ears when you swim
- try to avoid water or shampoo getting into your ears when you shower or bath
- treat conditions that affect your ears, such as eczema or an allergy to hearing aids
