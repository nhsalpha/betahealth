## What happens at your appointment

Your GP will often use a small light (an otoscope) to look into the ear.

Some otoscopes blow a small puff of air into the ear. This checks for blockages,
which could be a sign of an infection.

## Treatment from your GP

Your GP may prescribe medicine for your ear infection, it depends what’s
caused it.

### For inner ear infections

Antibiotics aren’t always recommended for an inner ear infections as they often
clear up on their own. They might be prescribed if you or your child:

- has an ear infection that doesn’t get better
- is under 2
- has an illness that means there’s a risk of complications, such as cystic fibrosis

### For outer ear infections

Your GP might prescribe:

- antibiotic ear drops - to treat a bacterial infection
- steroid ear drops - to bring down swelling
- antifungal ear drops - to treat a fungal infection
- antibiotic tablets - if your bacterial infection is severe

If you have a spot or boil in your ear, your GP may pierce it with a needle
to drain the pus.

Ear drops may not work if they’re not used in the right way.
