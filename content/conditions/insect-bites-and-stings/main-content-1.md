## First aid for insect bites and stings

To deal with any redness, swelling and any stinging or burning pain:

1. remove the sting if you can see it
2. clean the wound with soap and water
3. apply something cold to the skin - for example a damp cloth or ice pack
4. raise the hand, foot or leg if thatâ€™s where bite or sting is
