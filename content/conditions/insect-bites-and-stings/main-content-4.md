## Preventing insect bites and stings

To help prevent insect bites and stings:

- use an insect repellent - those containing 50% DEET (diethyltoluamide) are most effective
- cover exposed skin - especially at sunrise and sunset when insects are more active
- cover food and drink because the colours and smells attract insects
- donâ€™t disturb insect nests - check if your council can remove the nest for you or search online for pest control services
