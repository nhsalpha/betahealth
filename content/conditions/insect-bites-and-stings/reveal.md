### Removing stings

Brush or scrape the sting out sideways using something with a hard edge, for example a bank card or your fingernails.

Don’t use tweezers or try to pull it out because this can spread the venom.

If you can’t remove the sting it will usually come out by itself and is often not harmful.

### Removing caterpillar hairs

Use tweezers or a pen to lift the caterpillar away and sticky tape to remove any hairs.

Don’t use your hands or brush the caterpillar away as it will release more hairs. It’s the hairs that cause the skin irritation.

Wash your clothes at the highest possible temperature to remove any hairs.
