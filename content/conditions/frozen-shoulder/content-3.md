## Treatment from your GP

Broadly, treatment works in 3 main steps:

1. **Pain relief** - avoid movements that cause you pain. Only move your shoulder gently. Use paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease the pain. 
1. **Stronger pain and swelling relief** - prescribed painkillers. Maybe steroid injections in your shoulder to bring down the swelling.
1. **Getting movement back** - shoulder exercises once itâ€™s less painful. This can be at home or with a physiotherapist.

Your GP might mix these treatments. This depends on how painful and stiff your shoulder is.

Stronger pain relief is usually only used for a short time because it can cause side effects.

## How long frozen shoulder lasts

Frozen shoulder usually takes at least 1.5 to 2 years to get better. Sometimes it can be up to 5 years.

However, the pain and stiffness will usually go away eventually.
