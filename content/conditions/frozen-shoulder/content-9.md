## Causes of frozen shoulder

Frozen shoulder happens when the tissue around your shoulder joint becomes inflamed. 

The tissue then gets tighter and shrinks which causes pain.

Frozen shoulder can happen because: 

- you had an injury or surgery that keeps you from moving your arm normally
- you have diabetes - it’s still unclear why this is but it’s important to have your [regular diabetes check ups](/conditions/type-2-diabetes/going-for-regular-check-ups)  to catch any problems early

However, it’s often not clear why people get a frozen shoulder.
