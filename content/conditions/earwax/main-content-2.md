Usually earwax falls out on its own. If it doesn’t and blocks your ear, put 2 to 3 drops of olive or almond oil in your ear twice a day for a few days. Over a week or 2 weeks large lumps of earwax can fall out of your ear, especially at night when you’re lying down.

There is no proof that ear candles or ear vacuums get rid of earwax.

## Your pharmacist can help with earwax build-up

To dissolve the earwax you can buy chemical drops from a pharmacy.

The earwax should fall out on its own or dissolve after about a week.

Don’t use drops if you have a hole in your eardrum. Ask your pharmacist what you can do instead.
