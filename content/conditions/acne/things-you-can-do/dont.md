### Don’t

- pick or squeeze your spots as this makes them worse and can cause scarring
- wash the area more than twice a day - washing too often can make acne worse
- scrub too hard - this can irritate the skin and make your acne worse
- smoke or drink too much alcohol - these things can make your acne worse
- get stressed about things if possible - this can make your acne worse
- put toothpaste on your spots - it can damage your skin
- sunbathe or use sunbeds to get rid of acne - there’s little proof it helps
- spend too much time in very humid air - it can make your acne worse
- believe anyone who tells you sex or masturbation makes acne worse or passes
  it on to other people - this isn’t true
