### Do

- talk to your pharmacist if you have mild acne - they can recommend products
  with benzoyl peroxide
- use a mild, oil-free soap or gentle cleanser and lukewarm water to wash the
  areas with acne or to remove make up - hot or cold water can make your acne worse
- moisturise because some acne treatments dry out your skin - ask your
  pharmacist which moisturisers  to use
- use skin products and makeup labelled 'non-comedogenic' or 'non-acnegenic' -
  this means they shouldnâ€™t make your acne worse
- use oil-free or water-based make up
- shower as soon as you finish exercising
- wash your hair regularly and keep it out of your face
