## What causes spots and acne

You get spots when your skin pores become blocked. This happens when the skin
produces too much oil. The oil mixes with dead skin cells and forms a plug.

Bacteria can infect the blocked pore. This leads to spots.

Why skin can produce too much oil isn’t clear. It could be because of a
hormone called testosterone. During puberty your body produces more
testosterone. It’s possible that the testosterone tells the glands to produce
more oil than is needed.

## Conditions and medicines that can cause acne

Examples include:

- [polycystic ovarian disease](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Polycystic-ovarian-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx) - acne is a symptom of this illness
- medicines such as steroids, hormones and anti-epileptic drugs

## Diet and natural remedies

There is little medical proof that what you eat can cause acne.

Also, there is little proof that natural remedies help with acne.
