## Moderate and severe acne

It’s important to see a GP for [moderate and severe acne](/acne/what-acne-can-look-like)
because these types of acne can leave scars.

Try not to put this off. Even if your acne comes and goes and might sometimes
look better you can still get scars.

If you feel comfortable with it you can take a selfie when your acne is more
severe. This can help your GP to find the right treatment for you. Don’t take
pictures of your chest or breasts.

Your GP will ask things like:

- how long you’ve had acne
- if there are things you know of that make it worse
- how it’s affecting your life
- if there is anyone in your family with acne
- treatments you’ve used before

It’s important you tell your GP how your acne is affecting your life, for example
your self-confidence.

### Treatments from your GP

Your GP will talk you through treatments suitable for your level of acne and
your skin type. Together you can decide what to try first.

Treating acne is not always straightforward and you might have to try
different treatments.
