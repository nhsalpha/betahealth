## Causes of UTIs

UTIs are usually caused by bacteria from poo entering the urinary tract. The bacteria enters through the tube that carries pee out of the body (urethra).

Women have a shorter urethra than men. This means bacteria is more likely to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause an infection.

Causes of UTIs include:

- pregnancy
- conditions that block the urinary tract - such as [kidney stones](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/kidney-stones/Pages/Introduction.aspx)
- conditions that make it difficult to fully empty the bladder - such as an [enlarged prostate gland](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Prostate-enlargement/Pages/Introduction.aspx) in men and [constipation](https://beta.nhs.uk/conditions/constipation) in children
- [urinary catheters](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/urinary-catheterization/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (a tube in your bladder used to drain urine)
- having a weakened immune system â€“ for example, from [type 2 diabetes](/conditions/type-2-diabetes/check-if-you-have-it), chemotherapy or HIV
