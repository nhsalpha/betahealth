## Sexual health clinics can help with UTIs

Sexual health clinics treat problems with the genitals and urinary tract, including UTIs.

They can provide the same antibiotics you would get at your GP surgery.

Many sexual health clinics also offer a walk-in service, where you don't need an appointment.
