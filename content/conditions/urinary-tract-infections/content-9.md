## What happens at your appointment

You'll be asked about your symptoms and may need to give a urine sample to confirm you have a UTI.

A urine test helps to rule out other conditions that might be causing your symptoms.

Men are sometimes offered a painless swab test to check for other conditions. This is where a cotton bud is wiped on the tip of the penis and sent for testing.

This won’t hurt, but may feel uncomfortable.

## Treating UTIs

Your doctor or nurse will prescribe antibiotics to treat a UTI.

Once you start treatment, the symptoms should start to clear up within 5 days in adults and 2 days in children.

It’s important to finish the whole course of antibiotics, even if you start to feel better.

Some people with a severe UTI may be referred to hospital for treatment and tests. You may need to stay for a few days. Hospital treatment is more likely for men and children with a UTI.

### Treating recurring UTIs

If your UTI comes back any time after treatment, you'll usually be prescribed a longer course of antibiotics.

If you keep getting UTIs and regularly need treatment, your GP may give you a repeat antibiotics prescription.

## Things you can do yourself

Mild UTIs often pass within a few days. To help ease pain while your symptoms clear up:

- take paracetamol - you can give children liquid paracetamol
- place a hot water bottle on your tummy, back or between your thighs
- rest and drink plenty of fluids - this helps your body to flush out the bacteria

It may also help to avoid having sex until you feel better. You can't pass a UTI on to your partner but sex may be uncomfortable.
