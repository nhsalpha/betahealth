## How to treat tendonitis yourself

Follow the 4 steps known as RICE therapy for 2 to 3 days to help bring down swelling and support the injury:

1. **Rest** - stop the exercise or activities that caused the injury until you feel better
1. **Ice** - put an ice pack (you could use a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a teatowel) on the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours
1. **Compress** - wrap a bandage around the injury to support it
1. **Elevate** - if possible, keep the injured area raised on a pillow when sitting or lying down

To help prevent swelling during the first 2 to 3 days, try to avoid:

- heat, such as hot baths and heat packs
- alcohol
- massages

When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the tendon doesnâ€™t become stiff.

## Your pharmacist can help with tendonitis

Your pharmacist can recommend the best painkiller. This might be tablets or a cream or gel you rub on the skin.

Paracetamol and ibuprofen can help to ease mild pain. Wait for 48 hours after your injury before taking ibuprofen, because it can slow down healing.
