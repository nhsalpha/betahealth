## Check if it is tendonitis

There are tendons all over your body. They connect your muscles to bones, for example in your knees, elbows and shoulders.

The main symptoms of tendonitis are:

- pain in a tendon (for example, in your knee, elbow or shoulder) which gets worse when you move
- difficulty moving the tendon
- feeling a grating or crackling sensation when you move the tendon
- swelling, sometimes with heat or redness
- a lump along the tendon

There are many different types of tendonitis, depending on which area of the body is affected.
