## What happens at your appointment

Your GP will ask you about your lifestyle and medical history. If the reason for the anaemia is not clear (like pregnancy) your GP might order some tests to find out what might be causing the symptoms. They might also refer you to a specialist for further checks.

### Blood tests for iron deficiency anaemia

Your GP will usually order a full blood count (FBC) test. This will find out if the number of red blood cells you have (your RBC count) is normal.

You don’t need to do anything to prepare for this test.

A normal RBC count is:

- **women** - 4.2 to 5.4 million cells per microlitre (cells/mcL)
- **men** - 4.7 to 6.1 million cells/mcL

Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type of anaemia. There are others, like vitamin B12 and folate anaemia, which the blood test will also check for.

## Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia

Once the reason you have anaemia has been found (for example, an ulcer or heavy periods) your GP will recommend treatment.

If your blood test shows your red blood cell count is low (deficient) you’ll be prescribed iron tablets to replace the iron missing from your body.

The prescribed tablets are stronger than the supplements you can buy in pharmacies and supermarkets.

You’ll have to take them for about 6 months.

Drinking orange juice after you’ve taken them may help your body absorb the iron.

Some people get side effects like:

- constipation or diarrhoea
- tummy pain
- heartburn
- feeling sick
- black poo

Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It’s important to keep taking the tablets even if you get side effects.
