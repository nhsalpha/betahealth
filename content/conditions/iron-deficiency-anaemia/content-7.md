Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron levels are back to normal.

## Things you can do yourself

If your diet is partly causing your iron deficiency anaemia, your GP will tell you what foods are rich in iron so you can eat more of them.

###  Eat and drink more:

- dark green leafy vegetables like watercress and curly kale
- cereals and bread with extra iron in them (fortified)
- meat
- pulses (beans, peas and lentils)

Other foods that are a good source of [iron](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vitamins-minerals/Pages/Iron.aspx).

### Eat and drink less:

- tea
- coffee
- milk and dairy
- walnuts and almonds

Large amounts of these food and drinks make it harder for your body to absorb iron.

If you're finding it hard to include iron in your diet you might be referred to a specialist dietician.

## Causes of iron deficiency anaemia

If youâ€™re pregnant iron deficiency anaemia is most often caused by a lack of iron in your diet.

Heavy periods and pregnancy are very common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. Heavy periods can be treated with medication.

For men, and for women whose periods have stopped, iron deficiency anaemia can be a sign of bleeding in the stomach and intestines caused by:

- taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen and aspirin)
- stomach ulcers
- swelling of the large intestine (colitis) or of the food pipe (oesophagus)
- piles
- less often - cancers of the bowel or stomach

Any other conditions or actions that cause blood loss could lead to iron deficiency anaemia.

## If you leave your iron deficiency anaemia untreated

Untreated iron deficiency anaemia:

- can make you more at risk of illness and infection, as a lack of iron affects the immune system
- may increase your risk of developing complications that affect the heart or lungs, such as an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) or heart failure
- in pregnancy can cause a greater risk complications before and after birth
