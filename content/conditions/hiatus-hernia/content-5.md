## Treatment for a hiatus hernia

Broadly, treatment follows these steps:

1. **Change your eating habits** - for example eating smaller meals more often and doing [other things to help with the symptoms of GORD](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/Pages/Treatment.aspx#self-help).
1. **Buy medicines from the pharmacy** - ask the pharmacist what you should take to help with the symptoms of GORD.
1. **See a GP** - if changing your eating habits and medicines from the pharmacy don’t help your GP can prescribe stronger medicines.
1. **Further tests** - if stronger medicines don’t work your GP can send you for further tests to find out if your symptoms are caused by a hiatus hernia. They might also prescribe medicines for long-term GORD.
1. **Surgery** - your GP might refer you to a specialist to check if you need surgery. This usually only happens if other treatments haven’t worked and you keep having very bad symptoms.

### Surgery for a hiatus hernia

Surgery for hiatus hernia is usually keyhole surgery (done through small cuts in your tummy area - your abdomen). It’s done under general anaesthetic - you'll be asleep during the operation.

After surgery it usually takes:

- 2 to 3 days to go home
- 3 to 6 weeks to go back to work
- 6 weeks before you can eat what you want
- a few months to recover from side effects like bloating, belching, farting and difficulty when swallowing

There's a small risk (about 1 in 100) that your side effects won't go away and you'll need more surgery.

## What causes a hiatus hernia

It’s not clear what causes a hiatus hernia. Anyone can have one, but it’s more common if you’re over 50, pregnant or overweight.
