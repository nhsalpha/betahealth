## Check if you have a hiatus hernia

You can have a hiatus hernia without knowing, and without it being a problem.

With a hiatus hernia you can have:

- a painful burning feeling inside the chest, often after eating (heartburn)
- bringing up small amounts of food or bitter tasting fluids (acid reflux)
- bad breath
- feeling bloated and belching
- feeling or being sick
- difficulty or pain when swallowing

These are the symptoms of [gastro-oesophageal reflux disease](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Gastroesophageal-reflux-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx) (GORD).
