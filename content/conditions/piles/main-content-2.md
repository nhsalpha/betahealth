GPs are used to dealing with piles so try not to feel embarrassed. 

Your GP may prescribe stronger creams or [laxatives](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Laxatives/Pages/Introduction.aspx). 

If treatment doesnâ€™t work and your piles are affecting your everyday life, your GP may refer you to a specialist
for [treatment in hospital](http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Haemorrhoids/Pages/Surgery.aspx).
